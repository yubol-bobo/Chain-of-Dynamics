Causal Temporal Graph Attention (CTGA) Model

---

**Model Overview:**
The CTGA (Causal Temporal Graph Attention) model is designed for sequential healthcare data, where modeling temporal and causal relationships is crucial. CTGA leverages a novel causal temporal graph attention mechanism that allows each time step to attend only to its own and past representations, explicitly enforcing causality and preventing information leakage from the future.

**Design Intuition:**
- **Causality:** Unlike standard transformers or attention models, CTGA enforces strict causality by masking attention to only past and current time steps. This is critical for clinical prediction tasks, where using future information would lead to data leakage and unrealistic performance.
- **Temporal Graph Attention:** For each possible lag (up to a maximum), CTGA applies a separate multi-head attention mechanism, learning how much each lag contributes to the current prediction. The model learns lag importance weights, allowing it to adaptively focus on the most relevant temporal dependencies.
- **Feature Interaction Gating:** After aggregating lagged information, a feature gate modulates the output, allowing the model to learn complex feature interactions and suppress irrelevant signals.
- **Interpretability:**
    - The model stores temporal attention weights and intermediate representations, enabling detailed post-hoc analysis of which time points and features contributed most to a prediction.
    - The `compute_contributions` method provides per-feature, per-time-step contribution scores for individual patients.
- **Positional Encoding:** Standard sinusoidal positional encodings are added to the input embeddings to help the model distinguish between different time steps.
- **Temporal Importance Scoring:** After the attention layers, a temporal scorer assigns an importance weight to each time step, allowing the model to focus on the most critical periods in the sequence.

**Why CTGA Performed Best:**
- By explicitly modeling both short- and long-term temporal dependencies with causal masking and lag-specific attention, CTGA captures the true progression of patient states over time.
- The learnable lag importance and feature gating mechanisms allow the model to adapt to complex, real-world clinical data, where the relevance of past events can vary widely.
- Its interpretability features make it especially suitable for healthcare, where understanding model decisions is as important as predictive accuracy.

**Key Features:**
- Causal (future-masked) multi-head attention for each lag
- Learnable lag importance weights
- Feature interaction gating
- Temporal importance scoring and weighted aggregation
- Full interpretability: temporal and feature contributions
- Robust to overfitting via dropout and normalization

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# CTGA vs. TFCAM: Key Differences
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# 1. Causality and Temporal Attention
#    - CTGA: Strict causal masking (no future info), lag-specific attention, learns lag importance.
#    - TFCAM: Flexible attention (can attend to future unless masked), standard transformer attention.
#
# 2. Feature Interaction
#    - CTGA: Feature gating after temporal aggregation.
#    - TFCAM: Cross-feature attention at each time step.
#
# 3. Interpretability
#    - CTGA: High (temporal/feature contributions, explicit lag weights).
#    - TFCAM: Moderate (attention maps for time and features).
#
# 4. Positional Encoding
#    - Both use positional encodings, but CTGA's causal masking enforces temporal order.
#
# 5. Use Cases and Performance
#    - CTGA: Best for clinical/forecasting tasks where causality and interpretability are critical.
#    - TFCAM: Best for tasks with complex feature interactions, less strict on causality.

# | Aspect              | CTGA                                | TFCAM                              |
# |---------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
# | Causality           | Strict, future-masked               | Flexible, may attend to future     |
# | Temporal Modeling   | Lag-specific attention, lag weights | Standard transformer attention     |
# | Feature Interaction | Feature gating after temporal attn  | Cross-feature attention            |
# | Interpretability    | High (temporal/feature contribs)    | Moderate (attention maps)          |
# | Best Use Case       | Clinical, interpretable forecasting | Complex feature interaction tasks  |
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# In summary, CTGA is designed for strict causal modeling and interpretability, making it ideal for healthcare and forecasting, while TFCAM is more general-purpose for complex feature interactions.
