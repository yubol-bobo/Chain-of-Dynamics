# Assets Directory

This directory contains visual assets used in the repository documentation and README.

## Images

### `images/influence_network.png`
- **Description**: Chain-of-Influence network visualization showing temporal-feature interdependencies
- **Usage**: Featured prominently in main README
- **Details**: Network diagram where node size reflects feature importance, arrow thickness indicates influence strength, and colors distinguish influence types (blue: positive influence, red: negative influence)

### `images/temporal_attention_comparison.png`
- **Description**: Comparison of temporal attention patterns between RETAIN and CoI models
- **Usage**: Interpretability visualization in README
- **Details**: Shows how CoI demonstrates pronounced attention focusing on critical time periods (t6-t7) compared to RETAIN's more uniform attention distribution

## Usage Guidelines

- These images are used to showcase the model's capabilities in the README
- High-resolution versions suitable for GitHub display
- Images are version-controlled and should be updated when model visualizations change
- Maintain descriptive filenames and include alt-text for accessibility
